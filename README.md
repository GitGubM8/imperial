## I need to write setup instructions!

## What the heck is a _Schnelleinsteig_??

You may notice a couple files, `schnelleinsteigLog.js` and `schnelleinsteig.test.js`. The first of these is a log taken from an imaginary 5-round game that was described in a pamphlet that came with my copy of the game. The second of these is a series of tests that helped motivate early development of the core game logic. They are currently in the process of being phased out in favor of the tests in `imperial.test.js`.
